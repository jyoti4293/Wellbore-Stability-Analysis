# Wellbore-Stability-Analysis
Understand failure patterns with anisotropic rock strengths and determine minimum mud weight required to maintain stability

## Contents-
1. Jupyter Notebook- .ipynb file of the code
2. Python file- .py file of the code

## Scope-
The python file is further used to create an executable application which is user friendly, can be ealisy installed and run.
The application is used by India's leading E&P company to predict optimum mud weight given the dimensions of the borehole. It helps solve various catastrophic events related to imbalanced pore presssure such as blowouts etc.  

### Reference-
The following paper have been implemented in this project- [A_wellbore_stability_model_for_formations_with_anisotropic_rock_strengths](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271414193_A_wellbore_stability_model_for_formations_with_anisotropic_rock_strengths)
