# Wellbore-Stability-Analysis
To understand failure patterns of boreholes with anisotropic rock strengths and determine minimum mud weight required to maintain wellbore stability

## Contents-
1. Jupyter Notebook- .ipynb file of the code
2. Python file- .py file of the code

## Scope-
The python file is further used to create an executable application which is user friendly, can be ealisy installed and run.
The application is t par industry level to predict optimum mud weight and understand failure pattern for any given dimensions of the borehole. It helps solve various catastrophic events related to imbalanced pore presssure such as blowouts etc.
